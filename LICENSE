- *MiniFMOD is not FMOD*.  The code is a complete hack, and does
  by no way represent the source contained within the main FMOD library.
  I stripped and copied code around, took out functions and
  inlined them (ie i put waveout code in the music file!), and generally
  turned it upside down to try and squeeze some size!
- MiniFMOD may not replay XM files 100% as FMOD does, due to some cutting of
  corners.  It seems to be ok so far.
- This source is provided as-is.  Firelight Technologies will not support or answer
  questions about the source provided.  (unless there are some REALLY nasty bugs..
  remember im NOT going to spend time on this! fix it yourself!)

- This source must not be redistributed without this text.
- The source can be modified, and redistributed as long as no copyright or comment
  blocks (see at the top of each source file) are removed.
